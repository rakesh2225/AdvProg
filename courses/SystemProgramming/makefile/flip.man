[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mFlip[24m  is  a  file  interchange  program that converts text file formats
       between **IX and MS-DOS.  It converts lines ending with carriage-return
       (CR)  and  linefeed  (LF)  to  lines ending with just linefeed, or vice
       versa.

       [4mFlip[24m has the following features.

       o      If a file contains isolated CR  characters  for  underlining  or
              overprinting, [4mflip[24m does not change them.

       o      When  asked to convert a file to the same format that it already
              has, [4mflip[24m causes no change to the file.   Thus  to  convert  all
              files to **IX format you can type

                 [4mflip[24m [1m-u [22m*.*  (under MS-DOS)
                 [4mflip[24m [1m-u [22m*    (under **IX)

            and  all  files will end up right, regardless of whether they were
            in MS-DOS or in **IX format to begin with.  This also works in the
            opposite direction.

       o    [4mFlip[24m preserves file timestamps.  You can override this.

       o    [4mFlip[24m  is  written in C and will compile and run under MS-DOS/Turbo
            C, 4.3BSD, and System V.

       o    [4mFlip[24m accepts wildcards and multiple filenames on the command line.

       o    If a user interrupt aborts [4mFlip[24m, it  does  not  leave  behind  any
            garbage files or cause corruption of the files being converted.

       o    [4mFlip[24m  will normally refuse to convert binary files.  You can over-
            ride this.

       o    When converting from MS-DOS  to  **IX  format,  [4mflip[24m  removes  any
            trailing  control  Z  (the last character in the file), but leaves
            embedded control Z characters unchanged.  This minimizes the  pos-
            sibility  of accidentally converting a binary file that contains a
            control Z near the beginning.  You can override this and ask  [4mflip[0m
            to recognize the first control Z found as end-of-file.

       o    [4mFlip[24m  can be asked to strip the high (parity) bit as it converts a
            file.

       [4mFlip[24m is normally invoked as:

            [4mflip[24m [1m-umhvtb [22mfile ...


       One of [1m-u[22m, [1m-m[22m, or [1m-h [22mis required.  Switches may be given separately  or
       combined  together  after a dash.  For example, the three command lines
       given below are equivalent:

            [4mflip[24m [1m-uvt [22m*.c
            [4mflip[24m [1m-u -v -t [22m*.c
            [4mflip[24m [1m-u -vt [22m*.c

       The meanings of the switches are as follows.

       -u     convert to **IX format (CR LF => LF, lone CR  or  LF  unchanged,
              trailing control Z removed, embedded control Z unchanged)

       -m     convert to MS-DOS format (lone LF => CR LF, lone CR unchanged)

       -h     give a help message

       -v     be verbose, print filenames as they are processed

       -t     touch files (don't preserve timestamps)

       -s     strip high bit

       -b     convert binary files too (else binary files are left unchanged)

       -z     truncate file at first control Z encountered

       On  systems  that  allow  a  program  to know its own name, [4mflip[24m may be
       renamed (or linked) to a file called [4mtoix[24m (or  [4mtoix.exe[24m  under  MS-DOS)
       for  conversion  to  **IX format, or to a file called [4mtoms[24m (or [4mtoms.exe[0m
       under MS-DOS) for conversion to MS-DOS format.  When invoked  with  the
       name  [4mtoix[24m  or [4mtoms,[24m [4mflip[24m will act as if it were invoked with the [1m-u [22mor
       [1m-m [22moption respectively.
