1. Because the clients are reading only one byte at a time and they
   are not waiting for the EOF from the server before terminating. Since there
   is no client listening to the release pipe, server gets blocked forever as 
   the release pipe is no longer opened for read by any process. Hence the
   server gets straded.

2. Since only one byte is read by the server at a time from the pipe,
   server is safe from any malicious clients.
